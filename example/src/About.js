       <h2>About Us!</h2>
       <p>With a vision of providing customer oriented IT services, a group of experienced IT professionals came together to initiate ABC & Co. Consultancy Services Private Limited in the early 2011. After a lot of consideration and market research, ABC Co. was setup in the heart of central India having a huge talent pool and easy access to bigger domestic & International markets. In such a small time of its existence ABC has established itself as one of the leading IT service provider in the region, bagging numerous clients in its portfolio. Besides, ABC is an ISO 9001:2008 certified company.
The founders have had years of experience through leading IT companies in the world, catering to Fortune 500 companies in multiple geographies across the world.
